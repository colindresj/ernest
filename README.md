##Ernest
**Ernest** is a web-based writing utility with built-in version control and thought-about online editing.

###How It Works
#####Version Control
Version control works kind of like Git. Log in to your account and write using the distraction-free editor. Whenever you want to save a version, commit it to Ernest and a version will be recorded. You can switch between your current version and any previously recorded version through the online editor, preview what your writing looked like in versions past, and even revert back to a previous version.

#####Editing
Whenever you create a writing on Ernest you can send it to any other Ernest user with editing rights. They'll be able to pull up the writing, suggest some changes and send it back your way, where you'll be able to review the recommended changes and either approve or reject them. If you approve any recommended changes, a new version will be created with the changes merged in -- seamless writer/editor flow.

#####Editing
You can also hook Ernest up to your Dropbox account, so that all the most recent versions of your writings are always available to you wherever you may be. To do so, just go to your account settings and authenticate Ernest to access your Dropbox account. A new 'Ernest' folder will be created in your Dropbox directory and all of your writings will be easily synced between Ernest online and your Dropbox folder.
